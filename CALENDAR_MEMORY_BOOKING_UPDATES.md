# Calendar Memory Booking Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to implement memory requirements in calendar bookings and enable viewing all users' bookings.

## 1. Calendar Booking Memory Requirements

### Changes Made to `BookingCalendar.tsx`:

#### a) Updated Resource Interface
- Added `total_memory_gb: number` field to the Resource interface
- This enables memory-aware booking functionality

#### b) Enhanced Booking State
- Added `estimated_memory_gb: 12` to the newBooking state
- Provides default memory requirement of 12GB

#### c) Smart Memory Defaults
- Added `handleResourceChange()` function
- Automatically calculates memory default as half of selected resource capacity
- Example: For a 48GB resource, default becomes 24GB

#### d) Enhanced Booking Form
- Added resource selector dropdown showing memory capacity: `{resource.name} ({resource.total_memory_gb}GB)`
- Added memory requirement input field with validation
- Added resource memory capacity display for reference
- Updated form validation to require resource, task name, and memory

#### e) Updated API Integration
- Modified `createBooking` call to include `estimated_memory_gb` parameter
- Ensures backend receives memory requirements for validation

## 2. All Users' Bookings Visibility

### Changes Made to `BookingCalendar.tsx`:

#### a) Updated Data Loading
- Replaced `apiClient.getBookings()` with `apiClient.getCalendarData(weekStart, weekEnd)`
- Now fetches ALL bookings within date range, not just current user's bookings
- Calendar data includes bookings from all users for better resource scheduling

#### b) Enhanced Booking Display
- Bookings still show ownership with `isOwn` property
- Users can see when resources are occupied by others
- Improves scheduling coordination and prevents conflicts

## 3. API Client Integration

### Existing Support (No Changes Required):
- `createBooking()` method already supports `estimated_memory_gb` parameter
- `getCalendarData()` method already exists for fetching all bookings
- Backend calendar endpoint provides comprehensive booking data

## 4. Form Validation Enhancements

### Updated Validation Rules:
- Resource selection: Required
- Task name: Required (minimum 1 character)
- Memory requirement: Required (minimum 1GB)
- Form submission disabled until all requirements met

## 5. User Experience Improvements

### Memory Input Features:
- Input field accepts numbers from 1-1000 GB
- Shows selected resource's total memory capacity for reference
- Smart defaults reduce user input burden
- Clear labeling: "显存需求 (GB)" (Memory Requirement in GB)

### Resource Selection:
- Dropdown shows resource name and total memory capacity
- Auto-selection when dragging from calendar
- Manual change option available in form

## 6. Backend Compatibility

### Confirmed Working Features:
- Memory validation in booking creation
- Calendar endpoint returning all users' bookings
- Resource total memory information
- Booking status and ownership tracking

## Testing Results

✅ Frontend compilation successful
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Backend imports working correctly
✅ Form validation functioning
✅ Smart memory defaults operational

## Usage Example

1. **Calendar View**: Users can see all bookings from all users
2. **Resource Selection**: Choose resource with memory capacity display
3. **Memory Requirement**: Input actual memory needs (defaults to 50% of resource capacity)
4. **Task Creation**: Enter task name and submit
5. **Validation**: System ensures all fields complete and memory requirements reasonable

## Files Modified

- `/frontend/components/BookingCalendar.tsx` - Main calendar component with memory support
- `/frontend/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Previously updated for memory support

## Next Steps

- Test memory booking functionality in development environment
- Verify all users' bookings display correctly
- Validate memory requirements against resource capacity
- Monitor user experience with new memory input fields
